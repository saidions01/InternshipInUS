Understanding General Education Requirements :One of the benefits of being in the PSEO
program is the opportunity to work ahead
towards general education requirements.
General education is an important part of a
student’s overall education because it
integrates a broad range of skills and
knowledge essential for college educated
adults.

Why General Education?General education integrates a broad foundation of knowledge and skills with the study of contemporary
concerns. The goals and competencies within the curriculum are reflective of those capabilities essential for
all college-educated adults facing the twenty-first century, including:
o 1. Skills needed for effective understanding and communication can be found through reading,
listening, critical and integrative thinking, writing, speaking, and technological literacy.
o 2. Exploration of various ways of knowing through study of the content, methods of inquiry and creative
modes of a broad spectrum of disciplines.
o 3. Our common membership in the human community, coupled with awareness that we live in a
diverse world.
o 4. The interrelatedness of human society and the natural environment and the ethical dimensions of
political, social, and personal life and development of responsibility for lifelong learning.

General Education Guidelines
 A total of 44 credits must be completed to satisfy the general
education program at Minnesota State University, Mankato.
2. There are 11 required goal areas that students must complete,
the goal areas include: communication, critical thinking,
natural science, mathematics/logical reasoning, history and
social/behaviorial sciences, humanities and the arts, human
diversity, global perspectives, ethical and civic responsibility,
people and the environment, and performance and
participation.
3. A single course may be placed in more than goal area. Each
credit, however, may only be counted once in meeting the 44
credits.
4. The Critical Thinking Goal Area 2 may be satisfied by taking
a course or completing all of the other required goal areas.
5. For Bachelor of Science degrees in Electrical, Civil,
Computer, Integrated or Mechanical Engineering, and the
Nursing degree, general education requirements differ.
See the program requirements for a detailed explanation of
general education coursework for these degree programs.


Goal Area 1: Communication
Goal: To develop writers and speakers who use the English language effectively and who read, write, speak, and
listen critically. At a base, all students should complete introductory communication requirements early in their
college studies. Writing competency is an ongoing process to be reinforced through writing intensive courses and
writing across the curriculum. Speaking and listening skills need reinforcement. There are multiple opportunities for
interpersonal communication, public speaking and discussion.
PART A: English Composition
Requires one course, 3 credits or more, with a grade of at least “P” or “C” (2.0). A grade of C- does not satisfy the goal area.

Goal: To develop critical thinking, communication, and problem solving skills. Courses in this goal area must focus on skill
development and throughout the course will provide opportunities to exercise skills although the exercise of skills requires a

practice of a particular discipline or area of inquiry but rather will be skills that are common to different disciplines and
different areas of inquiry.

Diverse Cultures Requirement

that develops mutual respect for all and celebrates our differences.
In keeping with the spirit of this commitment, all Minnesota State Mankato under¬graduate students must satisfy the DCGR
for graduation. For purposes of further clarifying the DCGR, diversity is defined in comprehensive terms as the many faceted
ways in which human beings differ from one another. Often overlapping, these differences can include: age, gender,
national origin, sexual orientation, mental/ physical ability, race/ethnicity.
To fulfill this requirement, students must:
• Take at least one GOLD course and one PURPLE course OR two PURPLE courses.
• Each course must be at least three (3) credits.
• Students must take courses from two different disciplines to satisfy the diverse cultures requirement.
A course is denoted on e-services as being PURPLE or GOLD under the notes section on e-services.

BROAD DEGREE REQUIREMENTS:

120 total credits
40 credits at the 300-400 level
2.0 local MSU and overall GPA
If you have questions on these broad degree requirements, contact the College Advising Office.

GENERAL EDUCATION:

It is extremely important to have your general education assessed by the College Advising Office far in advance of your planned graduation date in order to avoid any extra coursework. The College Advising Office will be able to look at the courses you have already taken by reviewing your DARS report and together you can create a plan to finish these requirements:

Forty-four (44) total general education credits
Fulfilling goal areas 1a, 1b and 3-11 (requirements vary in each Goal Area)
Two (2) writing intensive courses from two (2) different disciplines (in addition to ENG 101)
Two (2) diverse cultures courses from two (2) different disciplines
Eight (8) credits of language (only required for some majors)
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS (CHECK YOUR UNDERGRADUATE CATALOG FOR YOUR ADMISSION TERM):

The bulk of advising for majors is completed within our individual departments. This gives students the opportunity to speak directly with an experienced faculty member within their chosen major who could also mentor the student throughout the rest of their academic experience. Generally, students discuss the following with their Faculty Advisor:

Admission to the major, including GPA and pre-requisite requirements
When to take each major core requirement
Selection of appropriate major electives
Selection of appropriate minor (if required)
Internships, individual study courses, volunteering and professional networking  





Computer Information Technology (BS)
Computer Information Technology (CIT) focuses on meeting the needs of users within an organizational and societal context through the selection, creation, application, integration and administration of computing technologies. The Bachelor of Science in CIT provides graduates with the skills and knowledge to undertake a successful information career in industry, business, education, or government.
